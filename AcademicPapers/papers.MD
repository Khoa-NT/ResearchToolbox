# Tools for Exploring and Analyzing Papers
<!-- I know you can use ChatGPT to summarize papers, but I still prefer to read the paper first, then use AI to summarize and generate podcast later. -->

For reading papers:
- Install [Google Scholar PDF Reader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-scholar-pdf-reader/dahenjhkoodjbpjheillcadbppiidmhp) to read online PDF papers, e.g., from ArXiv.
It's also has `AI outline` feature.


For searching papers:
- [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) will show you the graph of related papers (both Past and Future works).


For summarizing papers and generating podcast:
- [NotebookLM - Google](https://notebooklm.google.com/)
- [Illuminate - Google](https://illuminate.google.com/)
